# Implementation details of Microtasks

> The purpose of this document is to state how I implemented the microtasks and the technologies used during their implementation.

- Inorder to achieve the microtasks, I have used the XAMPP server to create and run a WordPress application locally.
- I then integrated Bootstrap with the WordPress website that I created in order to replicate the navigation bar that is present in the CHAOSS website.
- Then I added two navigation links in order tp show the implementation of plugins.
- The sections for which information was available was taken from the CHAOSS website, and for the rest lorem ipsum content was used.
- The microtasks needed me to include Knowledge Base plugin into the WordPress site which I was able to achieve successfully.
- Details about the implementation of the microtasks have been included in the microtasks repository.

This video demonstrates the implementation of Knowledge Base plugins on the locally developed WordPress website.
